# Burundi-Drummers

Happy Independence Day to all Burundians! 

This sketch is a small tribute to the country where I grew up in, Burundi, a small country in the heart of Africa. On this day, I remember the beautiful sound and performance of the drummers of Burundi.

This skeleton of this sketch was created with the help of p5.js following functions:
- 2D Primitives functions (triangle,rect,ellipse)
- vertex functions (vertex(), beginShape(), endShape())

The animation of the stick was achieved by hiding all sticks (iterating over a loop of stick coordinates and making them transparent), and by using frameCount to calculate the index of the current stick coordinates and display it.
